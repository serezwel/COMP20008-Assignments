# Project Information
This project contains two parts: Part A and Part B
## Part A
Part A focuses on data cleaning and visualization using the Pandas and Matplotlib modules.
This project performs data cleaning and visualization on the Covid-19 dataset provided by Our World in Data.
The tasks are mostly on organizing and visualizing data of the severeness of Covid-19 in each country throughout 2020.
## Part B
Part B focuses on text preprocessing and text searching, mainly using the re and NLTK modules.
This project performs preprocessing and searching on cricket-related articles from BBC News.
The preprocessing and searching includes techniques such as:
* Pattern Searching
* Stemming
* Vectorizing
 
where we identify the Document ID for each article and perform text searching with keywords.
